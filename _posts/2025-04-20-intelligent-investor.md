# Why *The Intelligent Investor* Should Be Your Starting Point in Stock Investing

If you’ve ever dipped a toe into the world of investing—especially through **social media** or financial news—you’ve probably felt like you're being pulled in a hundred different directions. Hot takes, trending stocks, charts flying everywhere... it’s a lot. And for someone just starting out, it can be confusing, overwhelming, and honestly, a bit risky if you're only relying on what's loudest online.

That’s why we think it’s worth going back to the basics. And for us, there’s no better place to start than with Benjamin Graham’s classic book, [*The Intelligent Investor*](https://amzn.to/42UM9S8).

## A Quiet Classic in a Loud World

First published in 1949, *The Intelligent Investor* is far from flashy—but that’s kind of the point. Graham lays out timeless ideas about how to approach investing with patience, logic, and a long-term mindset. It’s the kind of book that doesn’t try to predict the next big thing but instead helps you think more clearly about **risk**, **value**, and your own goals.

It’s also not a book that tells you what to buy or when to sell. Instead, it helps you figure out *how* to think about investing—something that’s easy to lose sight of when you’re scrolling through hot stock tips or watching markets move minute by minute.

## Why It’s Still Worth Reading Today

Even though it was written decades ago, the ideas in this book still feel super relevant. Graham talks about the difference between **investing** and **speculating**—between building a plan vs. chasing trends. And in a world where it's easy to get caught up in hype, those reminders feel more important than ever.

In the coming weeks, we’ll be publishing a few follow-up posts with some of our own takeaways from the book. These won’t be summaries or study guides, just reflections on what stood out to us and how we’re thinking about applying it to our own investing journey.

## Read It Yourself, Form Your Own View

To be clear: this is just our take. *The Intelligent Investor* is packed with ideas, and different parts will resonate with different people. We really encourage you to read it yourself and form your own view—it’s not a short read, but it’s one that sticks with you.

If you're just getting into **equity investing** or thinking about your first investments, give it a shot. Let’s build from the ground up—with some thoughtful foundations instead of just the latest noise.
